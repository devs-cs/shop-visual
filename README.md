# ShopVisual: Design Your World

When there are _billions_ of purchasable items, natural language queries are simply not enough to narrow the choices down.

**We are redefining shopping through accessible image interfaces.**

In the spirit of an image is worth 1000 words, we are making it easy to search for and find what would otherwise be complicated queries and allowing you to see those items, rather than simply describe them.

Change items in your environment with our generative tools or design items from scratch and purchase the results.

This is the **Next-Generation** of shopping, helping you buy exactly what you need rather than scrolling endlessly.

### How It Works

1. Enter a text prompt to generate an image, upload your own starting image, or sketch an outline to start.
2. Make thematic changes or generative edits through natural language and inpainting.
3. Find similar items online and for sale with one click.
4. Download images to make final touches in an editor of your choice.
